# To run all the CIME Fortran unit tests, run the following command:
# On yellowstone, this requires module load all-python-libs
#
# The creation of a temporary directory ensures that you are doing a completely
# clean build of the unit tests. (The use of the --clean flag to run_tests.py
# cleans most, but not all of the files created by the unit test build.) For
# rerunning the tests after an incremental change, you can instead use an
# existing build directory.
#
# We would encourage you to port these tests to other platforms.
# The test requires an install of pFunit available from
# https://sourceforge.net/projects/pfunit/
